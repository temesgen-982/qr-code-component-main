### Built with

  

- HTML5

- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid
  
### What I learned


```css
  justify-self: center;
```
You can definitely using ``` margin: auto; ``` to center a grid item but I wanted to use specific values on the margins for the sides of the main container.

### Continued development
